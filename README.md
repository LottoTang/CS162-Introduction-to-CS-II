# CS162-Introduction-to-CS-II

This course serves as the intermediate level in C++.  The more eye-catching projects are:

Week 1 : Tac-Tie-Toe

Week 3 : Dungeon Crawler (There is a little bug here ^_^ as the monster will not chase the player actively)

Week 6 : Student Record System (for entering user's information and search)

The other projects are some games, testing the use of different features of C++.
